# Reuse-checker

Reuse-checker is a web application to verify if a Git repository follows the
best practices defined by the [REUSE guidelines](https://reuse.software/).

It is deployed on <https://smart.inf.unibz.it/reuse>.

The overall idea of reuse-checker is depicted in the figure below: several machines can be used to analyze the repositories, each machine has an assigned id.
